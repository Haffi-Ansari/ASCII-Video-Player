## About the Project:
"Video to ASCII player" is a Python based terminal app that converts any video into moving ASCII art.
It basically uses OpenCV to process each video frame and coverts each frame into grayscale and maps brightness levels to characters. Each pixel is mapped to a corresponding ASCII character. Frames are displayed in the terminal sequentially by which it creates a motion, displaying a text-based movie in real time.

## Features:
- Play any video as ASCII art in real time.
- Adjustable output width for better detail.
- Works across all major OS.
- Simple code structure and also open-source which makes it     easy to modify.
